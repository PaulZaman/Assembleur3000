			<h2>Welcome to our website</h2>
			<p>
				We are a group of students from the University of Efrei Paris, studying Computer Science.
				We are currently in our 3rd year of study and we are working on a project for our Computer architecture course.
				Our project is to create an assembler in the language of our choice. We chose to create an assembler in JavaScript.
				We chose to use React to create the interface of our assembler.
